# lstm-4th-part-Build-and-Train-the-LSTM-Model
In Part 4, "Build and Train the LSTM Model," we construct the LSTM architecture using Keras, compile it with suitable loss and optimizer, and train it on the dataset. This step is crucial to enable the model to learn temporal patterns and make accurate predictions.
