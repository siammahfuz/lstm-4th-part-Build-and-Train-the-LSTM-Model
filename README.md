🧠 LSTM Model Training Module
This module is the 4th part of the LSTM series, focused on building and training Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for time-series prediction. It includes model architecture design, compilation, and training—essential for learning temporal dependencies in sequential data.

📊 Features
✅ Model Construction – Define flexible LSTM architectures using Keras Sequential API
✅ Compilation – Configure with customizable loss functions and optimizers
✅ Model Training – Fit the model with batch processing and validation support
✅ Early Stopping & Callbacks – Optional support for reducing overfitting
✅ Performance Tracking – Monitor training and validation loss during training

🧩 Function Descriptions
build_lstm_model(input_shape, units=50, dropout_rate=0.2)
Parameters:

input_shape: Shape of the input data (e.g., (time_steps, num_features))

units: Number of LSTM units

dropout_rate: Dropout rate for regularization

Returns:

Compiled LSTM model

train_lstm_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
Parameters:

model: Compiled LSTM model

X_train, y_train: Training data

epochs: Number of training epochs

batch_size: Size of training batches

validation_split: Fraction of data used for validation

Returns:

Trained model

Training history object

✅ Example Usage
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
from lstm_model_utils import build_lstm_model, train_lstm_model

# Assume X_train and y_train are already preprocessed and shaped
input_shape = (X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])
model = build_lstm_model(input_shape)

trained_model, history = train_lstm_model(model, X_train, y_train)
